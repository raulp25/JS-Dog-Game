Have you ever wondered how a pure vanilla JS game was done? Well, i did and for learning purposes, i took the chance that youtube offered me to learn how to "develop" a game from scratch in Vanilla JS. <br> <br> This experience showed me a different side of this industry. <br> 
Master use of Classes is necessary to accomplish this kind of projects, so that's the exciting part, learning to manipulate classes across modules. <br>



#This game is for pc but you can try to jump in your smartphone haha. <br> 
-<b>Use Arrows to move and jump </b>
-<b>Keep Press Enter to kill enemies </b> <br>
-<b>To restart refresh the browser with F5 </b> <br>
-<b>Try to make 50 points in 30 seconds </b> <br>
